## Clustering Markdown 9 Traits
This script will perform hierarchical clustering on samples in the input file.  Two sets of results will be generated.  Clustering with and without AMH included as a variable.

Input file is required to have all fields found in the sample file.

NOTE: If  you do not have multiple assay methods for a trait, use '1' as your value.  The script is written to adjust for assay method and without any method supplied, it will not run.
